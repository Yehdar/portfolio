# Portfolio Website
## Abstract
Got the opportunity to finally use ViteJS on a project. Basically, ViteJS provides immediate feedback on changes during a live session. For example, without it, you would have to refresh the webpage each time to see the new changes. Anyways, I used react and tailwindcss.

## Notes
- Remember to `npm run dev` to start the app on a localhost
- If the github page does not deploy, keep bumping pushes (still a theory) by updating readme
